# DBMS-Project
A simple GUI written in Python to push info into an Oracle SQL Database table

The Output only works for one table and is incomplete as it was just extra unnecessary code I wrote in my free time
If you would like to expand this project for your own use cases, I would suggest you start by learning about tkinter in python.

This project was presented to the concerned faculty in 2021.
The project has an MIT Licence.
